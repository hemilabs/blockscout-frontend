## Running and configuring the app

App is distributed as a docker image. Images are automatically built and pushed to the repository on every merge to the default branch. Here you can find information about the [package](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hemilabs/frontend/general) and its recent [releases](https://github.com/hemilabs/frontend/releases). If an image is required outside that automated flow, see [how to manually trigger the build and push workflow](./docs/MANUAL_BUILD.md).

You can configure your app by passing necessary environment variables when starting the container. See full list of ENVs and their description [here](./docs/ENVS.md).

```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file <path-to-your-env-file> hemilabs/frontend:latest
```

Alternatively, you can build your own docker image and run your app from that. Please follow this [guide](./docs/CUSTOM_BUILD.md).

For more information on migrating from the previous frontend, please see the [frontend migration docs](https://docs.blockscout.com/for-developers/frontend-migration).
